      <p>Spotify is a music streaming service that gives users access to millions of songs, podcasts, and audiobooks. Although its platform, its really annoying if you aren't willing to pay a monthly subscription. If you don't use the paid version you don't have access to  ad free listening. offline downloads, and higher audio quality. Users can create playlists, follow artists, and even follow their friends. Spotify is available on desktop, mobile, and smart devices, and even consoles. </p>

      <p>I use Spotify almost every day because it helps me focus while studying and just makes the whole day more enjoyable. Sometimes the song recommendations are elite and I feel like the app knows me better than I do. The interface is clean and simple. And being able to listen to Spotify no matter what device I'm on is also really convenient. Sure apple music can do the same thing but i prefer spotify because sometimes it has unreleased songs on it</p>
