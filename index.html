      <p>Spotify is a digital music streaming service that gives users access to millions of songs, podcasts, and audiobooks from artists all over the world. It operates as a business offering both free and premium subscription tiers, with the latter providing ad-free listening, offline downloads, and higher audio quality. Users can create playlists, follow artists, and discover new music through personalized recommendations. Spotify is available on desktop, mobile, and smart devices, making it a versatile platform for audio entertainment.</p>

      <p>I use Spotify almost every day because it helps me focus while studying and makes long commutes more enjoyable. I love how it curates playlists based on my listening habits—sometimes it feels like it knows my mood better than I do. The interface is clean and intuitive, and the ability to switch between devices seamlessly is a game-changer. Whether I’m vibing to lo-fi beats or catching up on podcasts, Spotify always has something that fits the moment.</p>
